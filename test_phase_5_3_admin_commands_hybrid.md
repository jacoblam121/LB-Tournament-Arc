# Phase 5.3 Administrative Commands - Hybrid Testing Suite

## Overview

This test suite validates the Phase 5.3 administrative commands that have been converted to hybrid commands (supporting both prefix `!` and slash `/` command invocations). The commands include:

1. `admin-reset-elo` - Reset a single player's Elo
2. `admin-reset-elo-all` - Reset ALL players' Elo (DESTRUCTIVE)  
3. `admin-undo-match` - Undo a match using inverse delta algorithm

## Key Improvements Tested

- ‚úÖ **Hybrid Command Support**: Both prefix and slash command invocations
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced UX**: Parameter descriptions and event name autocomplete
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Modal Workflow**: Replaced broken modal with button confirmation
- ‚úÖ **Permission Parity**: Owner-only access for both prefix and slash commands
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Confirmation**: Button-based confirmations for all destructive operations

## Pre-Test Setup

1. Ensure bot is running with latest Phase 5.3 hybrid command implementation
2. Verify you have owner permissions (your Discord ID matches `Config.OWNER_DISCORD_ID`)
3. Ensure test database has sample players and events for testing
4. Have Discord Developer Tools open to monitor slash command registration

## Test Section 1: Basic Hybrid Command Functionality

### Test 1.1: Slash Command Registration Verification

**Objective**: Verify all three admin commands are properly registered as slash commands

**Steps**:
1. Type `/` in Discord and wait for autocomplete
2. Look for the three admin commands: `/admin-reset-elo`, `/admin-reset-elo-all`, `/admin-undo-match`
3. For each command, verify parameter descriptions appear correctly
4. Check that event name parameters show autocomplete when typing

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All three commands appear in slash command autocomplete
- ‚úÖ Parameter descriptions are helpful and accurate
- ‚úÖ Event name autocomplete provides valid event suggestions
- ‚úÖ Commands are marked as owner-only (should not appear for non-owners)

### Test 1.2: Permission Verification (Slash Commands)

**Objective**: Verify owner-only permissions work correctly for slash commands

**Steps**:
1. **As the bot owner**: Try to use any of the three slash commands
2. **As a non-owner** (use another account or have someone else test): Try to use the commands
3. Verify permission error handling

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Owner can see and use all three slash commands
- ‚úÖ Non-owners either don't see the commands or get clear permission errors
- ‚úÖ Permission errors are user-friendly and informative

### Test 1.3: Permission Verification (Prefix Commands)

**Objective**: Verify owner-only permissions work correctly for prefix commands

**Steps**:
1. **As the bot owner**: Try prefix versions: `!admin-reset-elo`, `!admin-reset-elo-all`, `!admin-undo-match`
2. **As a non-owner**: Try the same prefix commands
3. Verify permission error handling

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Owner can use all three prefix commands
- ‚úÖ Non-owners get clear permission error messages
- ‚úÖ Prefix and slash command permissions behave identically

**Objective**: Test single player Elo reset using slash command syntax

**Setup**: Identify a test player with existing Elo in multiple events

**Steps**:
1. Use slash command: `/admin-reset-elo player:@testuser event_name:TestEvent reason:Testing reset`
2. Verify the confirmation embed appears with correct details

### Test 2.3: Global Player Elo Reset

**Objective**: Test resetting all events for a single player

**Steps**:
1. Use either command without specifying event: `!admin-reset-elo @testuser Global reset test`
2. Verify confirmation shows "ALL EVENTS" scope
3. Confirm and verify all player's event Elos are reset

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Confirmation clearly indicates global scope
- ‚úÖ All PlayerEventStats for the player are reset to 1000
- ‚úÖ Success message shows count of affected events

**Objective**: Test event name autocomplete functionality

**Steps**:
1. Start typing `/admin-reset-elo player:@testuser event_name:` 
2. Type partial event names and verify autocomplete suggestions
3. Test with both existing and non-existent event name fragments

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Autocomplete suggests relevant active events
- ‚úÖ Partial matches work correctly (e.g., "Super" suggests "Super Smash Bros")
- ‚úÖ Invalid events are handled gracefully
- ‚úÖ Autocomplete is limited to 25 suggestions

### Test 2.5: Error Handling

1. Try to reset a non-existent player
2. Try to reset with an invalid event name
3. Try to cancel the confirmation (click Cancel button)
4. Let the confirmation timeout (wait 30 seconds)

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for non-existent players
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for invalid events
- ‚úÖ Cancellation works properly
- ‚úÖ Timeout handling shows appropriate message
