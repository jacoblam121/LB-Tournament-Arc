# Phase 2.5 Special Policies & Features - Manual Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan validates the Phase 2.5 Special Policies & Features implementation, focusing on centralized error handling, draw policy enforcement, loading states, and ghost player support.

## Pre-Test Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Bot is running with Phase 2.5 changes deployed
2. Database contains test players with varied stats
3. Multiple clusters and events exist in the database
4. At least 2+ players for match testing scenarios

### Phase 2.5 Implementation Status ‚úÖ
‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: All Phase 2.5 features have been implemented:
- **Centralized Error Handling**: ErrorEmbeds utility class created and integrated
- **Draw Policy Enforcement**: Match validation prevents draws in 1v1 matches
- **Loading States**: Verified defer() pattern usage across all commands
- **Ghost Player Support**: Already implemented in previous phases

**PRIORITY TESTING**: Focus on error handling consistency and draw policy enforcement.

## Test Categories

**Pass/Fail**: [ ]

#### Test 1.2: Invalid Input Error Handling
**Objective**: Test centralized handling of invalid inputs

**Steps**:
1. Try `/leaderboard type:cluster` without specifying cluster

**Objective**: Verify draws are explicitly prevented in 1v1 matches

**Setup Note**: This test requires access to match reporting functionality. If match reporting is not available in current phase, mark as "Not Applicable".

**Steps**:
1. Attempt to create a match result where both players have placement=1
2. Try to submit match data that would result in a draw
3. Verify the validation error is caught and handled properly
4. Check that the error message is user-friendly

**Expected Results**:
- Match validation prevents draws with clear error message
- Error message: "Draws are explicitly not handled. Please cancel this match and replay."
- Red error embed displayed to user
- Match is not saved to database

**Pass/Fail**: [ ] / [N/A]

#### Test 2.2: Draw Policy Error Handling
**Objective**: Test the specific draw error embed

**Steps**:
1. Trigger a draw scenario (if possible through match reporting)
2. Verify ErrorEmbeds.draw_not_supported() is called
3. Check the error message content and formatting
4. Ensure the embed provides clear guidance

**Expected Results**:
- Error embed has title "Draw Not Supported"
- Error message explains draws are not handled
- Guidance provided: "Please cancel this match and replay"
- Consistent with other error embeds (red color, proper formatting)

4. Try commands that might take longer to process

**Expected Results**:
- All commands show "Bot is thinking..." message initially
- Loading state appears immediately after command execution
- Commands complete successfully after loading
- No timeout errors or interaction failures

**Pass/Fail**: [ ]
