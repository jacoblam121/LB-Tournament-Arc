# Phase 3.5 Manual Test Plan - Enhanced Match History System

## Overview
This test plan covers the enhanced match history system with comprehensive pagination and multi-view support. The system provides three new commands: `/match-history-player`, `/match-history-cluster`, and `/match-history-event` with cursor-based pagination and Discord UI components.

## Prerequisites
- Bot is running and connected to Discord
- Database has match and leaderboard data
- Phase 3.5 implementation is deployed
- Test user has appropriate permissions

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Verify Database State
```sql
-- Check that matches exist with participants
SELECT COUNT(*) as match_count FROM matches WHERE status = 'completed';
SELECT COUNT(*) as participant_count FROM match_participants;

-- Check leaderboard scores exist  
SELECT COUNT(*) as leaderboard_count FROM leaderboard_scores WHERE score_type = 'all_time';

-- Verify test player exists with some history
SELECT p.discord_id, p.display_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT mp.match_id) as matches,
       COUNT(DISTINCT ls.id) as leaderboard_scores
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN match_participants mp ON p.id = mp.player_id
LEFT JOIN leaderboard_scores ls ON p.id = ls.player_id
WHERE p.discord_id = YOUR_DISCORD_ID
GROUP BY p.discord_id, p.display_name;

-- Check cluster and event structure
SELECT c.name as cluster_name, e.name as event_name, e.scoring_type
FROM clusters c 
JOIN events e ON c.id = e.cluster_id 
WHERE c.is_active = true
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Test Data Preparation
Before testing, ensure you have:
- [ ] At least 5-10 completed matches with different participants
- [ ] At least 3-5 leaderboard score submissions  
- [ ] Multiple clusters with events
- [ ] Test players with varying amounts of history
- [ ] Both 1v1 and multi-player matches (if supported)
