# Phase 0 Security Fix Test Suite

## Overview
This test suite validates that the critical admin permission bypass vulnerability has been properly fixed in the Discord bot's admin permission checking system.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Ensure the bot is running with the updated `match_commands.py`
2. Have a test Discord server with:
   - A regular user (non-owner)
   - The bot owner account (configured in Config.OWNER_DISCORD_ID)

## Security Tests

### Test 1: Owner Permission Validation - Bot Owner
**Objective**: Verify bot owner can use owner-only features

**Steps**:
1. Use the bot owner Discord account (configured in Config.OWNER_DISCORD_ID)
2. Create an FFA match: `/ffa players:@user1 @user2 @user3`
3. Use owner force completion: `/match-report match_id:[ID] placements:@user1:1 @user2:2 @user3:3 force:true`

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Owner force completion should work
- ✅ Results should be recorded immediately without confirmation workflow
- ✅ Success embed should show "Owner Override" indication

### Test 2: Permission Denial - Regular User  
**Objective**: Verify regular users cannot use owner-only features

**Steps**:
1. Use a Discord account that is NOT the bot owner
2. Create an FFA match: `/ffa players:@user1 @user2 @user3`
3. Attempt owner force completion: `/match-report match_id:[ID] placements:@user1:1 @user2:2 @user3:3 force:true`

**Expected Result**:
- ❌ Should receive "Insufficient Permissions" error  
- ❌ Force completion should be denied
- ✅ Normal confirmation workflow should still work without `force:true`

**Note**: This test should work for both string parsing (placements provided) and modal UI (no placements, ≤5 players) paths.

### Test 3: Guild Context Validation
**Objective**: Verify owner checks work correctly in guild vs DM contexts

**Steps**:
1. Test owner commands in the guild (where they should work for bot owner)
2. Test if the bot handles DM contexts gracefully (should only allow bot owner)

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Bot owner permissions should work in guild
- ✅ DM context should only allow bot owner
- ✅ No AttributeError crashes in any context

### Test 4: Modal Owner Logic
**Objective**: Verify modal submission owner checks work correctly

**Steps**:
1. Create an FFA match with ≤5 players: `/ffa players:@user1 @user2 @user3`
2. **Owner Test**: Use bot owner account, run `/match-report match_id:[ID] force:true`, fill modal
3. **Non-Owner Test**: Use regular user account, run `/match-report match_id:[ID] force:true`, fill modal

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Bot owner with force:true should complete match immediately via modal
- ❌ Regular users with force:true should get "Insufficient Permissions" error via modal
- ✅ Regular users without force should use normal confirmation workflow
- ✅ No permission bypass vulnerabilities

## Regression Tests

### Test 5: Existing Functionality Preservation
**Objective**: Ensure security fixes don't break existing functionality

**Steps**:
1. Test normal match creation and reporting workflow
2. Test confirmation system for non-admin users
3. Test modal UI for ≤5 players
4. Test template system for 6-10 players

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ All existing functionality should work unchanged
- ✅ Confirmation workflow should work for regular users
- ✅ Modal and template systems should function normally

## Security Validation Checklist

- [ ] `is_admin_or_owner()` function properly checks guild context
- [ ] `is_user_admin_in_guild()` function handles User vs Member types
- [ ] No hardcoded owner-only checks bypass guild admin permissions
- [ ] All four vulnerable locations have been secured:
  - [ ] Line 174: PlacementModal admin check
  - [ ] Line 716: _check_match_permissions function
  - [ ] Line 1475: report_match_results force parameter
- [ ] Error messages are informative but don't reveal system internals
- [ ] No AttributeError crashes in DM contexts

## Code Quality Validation

- [ ] Type hints are correct (User | Member)
- [ ] Logging uses self.logger instead of print()
- [ ] Logic is simplified and readable
- [ ] No duplicate permission checking code

[Additional observations or comments]

## Approval
- [ ] All security tests pass
- [ ] No regression issues found
- [ ] Ready for Phase 1 implementation
```

## Notes for Developer

1. **Critical**: All admin permission checks now use centralized utility functions
2. **Security**: Bot owner always has permissions, guild admins have permissions in their guilds only
3. **Type Safety**: Functions handle both User and Member objects properly
4. **Context Aware**: Permission checks are aware of guild vs DM contexts
5. **Maintainable**: Centralized permission logic prevents future vulnerabilities

## Next Steps After Testing

If all tests pass:
- ✅ Mark Phase 0 as complete
- ✅ Proceed to Phase 1.1: Database Architecture Foundation
- ✅ Begin implementing per-event Elo system

If any tests fail:
- ❌ Debug and fix identified issues
- ❌ Re-run full test suite
- ❌ Do not proceed to Phase 1 until all security tests pass
