# Phase 1.3: CSV Parsing and Data Population - Manual Test Suite

## Overview
This test suite validates the CSV parsing system, data population functionality, and admin commands for managing tournament clusters and events.

## Prerequisites
- Discord bot is running and connected
- You have owner permissions (Config.OWNER_DISCORD_ID)
- CSV file "LB Culling Games List.csv" exists in project root
- Database is initialized

## Test Environment Setup

### Before Testing
1. **Backup Current Database** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cp tournament.db tournament_backup_phase_1.3_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db
   ```

2. **Verify CSV File**: Ensure "LB Culling Games List.csv" is present and readable

3. **Check Bot Status**: Confirm bot is online and responsive

## Test 1: Standalone CSV Population Script

### Test 1.1: Basic Script Execution
**Objective**: Verify the standalone populate_from_csv.py script works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Run the standalone script:
   ```bash
   python populate_from_csv.py
   ```

2. Check console output for:
   - "Starting CSV population script..."
   - Progress messages for cluster creation
   - Final summary with counts
   - No error messages

**Expected Results**:
- Script completes without errors
- Reports creation of 20 clusters
- Reports creation of 60+ events
- Log file created in logs/ directory

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 1.2: Script Output Validation
**Objective**: Verify correct parsing of complex scoring types

**Steps**:
1. Check the log file for evidence of complex parsing:
   - Look for events with suffixes like "Krunker (1v1)" and "Krunker (FFA)"
   - Verify "2v2" events are converted to "Team"
   - Check that leaderboard events have score_direction set

2. Count total events created (should be >70 due to mixed types)

**Expected Results**:
- Mixed scoring types create multiple events with suffixes
- All "2v2" entries become "Team" scoring type
- Leaderboard events have HIGH/LOW direction set appropriately
- Running/time events have "LOW" direction
- Score/points events have "HIGH" direction

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

## Test 2: Database Integration

### Test 2.1: Database Population via Bot
**Objective**: Verify the enhanced database import method works

**Steps**:
1. Clear existing data (if any):
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "DELETE FROM events; DELETE FROM clusters;"
   ```

2. Use the bot's database method to import:
   ```python
   # In a Python shell or test script:
   import asyncio
   from bot.database.database import Database
   
   async def test_import():
       db = Database()
       await db.initialize()
       async with db.get_session() as session:
           await db.import_clusters_and_events_from_csv(session, clear_existing=True)
       await db.close()
   
   asyncio.run(test_import())
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- No errors during import
- Same results as standalone script
- Enhanced parsing functions are used
- Existing data is cleared before import

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 2.2: Data Integrity Verification
**Objective**: Verify database contains correct data structure

**Steps**:
1. Check cluster count:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clusters;"
   ```

2. Check event count:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;"
   ```

3. Verify complex events exist:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, scoring_type FROM events WHERE name LIKE '%(%';"
   ```

4. Check score direction for leaderboard events:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, score_direction FROM events WHERE scoring_type = 'Leaderboard';"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- 20 clusters in database
- 70+ events in database
- Events with suffixes like "Krunker (1v1)" exist
- Leaderboard events have score_direction set (HIGH/LOW)

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

## Test 5: Data Verification and Business Logic

### Test 5.1: Complex Scoring Type Parsing
**Objective**: Verify specific complex cases are handled correctly

**Steps**:
1. Check for these specific events in the database:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, scoring_type FROM events WHERE name LIKE 'Krunker%';"
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, scoring_type FROM events WHERE name LIKE 'Brawhalla%';"
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, scoring_type FROM events WHERE name LIKE 'Rat.%';"
   ```

2. Verify the results match expected parsing:
   - "Krunker" with "1v1/FFA" should create "Krunker (1v1)" and "Krunker (FFA)"
   - "Brawhalla" with "1v1/2v2" should create "Brawhalla (1v1)" and "Brawhalla (Team)"
   - Rat games with "1v1, 2v2" should create both variants

**Expected Results**:
- Complex scoring types correctly split into separate events
- "2v2" normalized to "Team" scoring type
- Comma and slash separators both handled
- Event names have appropriate suffixes

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 5.2: Score Direction Inference
**Objective**: Verify score direction is correctly inferred for leaderboard events

**Steps**:
1. Check specific leaderboard events:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, score_direction FROM events WHERE name LIKE '%run%' OR name LIKE '%time%';"
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, score_direction FROM events WHERE name LIKE '%score%' OR name LIKE '%points%';"
   ```

2. Verify running/time events have "LOW" direction
3. Verify score/points events have "HIGH" direction

**Expected Results**:
- Running events (40 yd dash, 1 mi run, etc.) have score_direction = "LOW"
- Score-based events have score_direction = "HIGH"
- Time-based events (completion time) have score_direction = "LOW"
- Default leaderboard events have score_direction = "HIGH"

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 5.3: Player Limits Configuration
**Objective**: Verify events have correct min/max player limits

**Steps**:
1. Check player limits by scoring type:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT DISTINCT scoring_type, min_players, max_players FROM events ORDER BY scoring_type;"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- 1v1 events: min_players=2, max_players=2
- Team events: min_players=4, max_players=10
- FFA events: min_players=3, max_players=16
- Leaderboard events: min_players=3, max_players=16
