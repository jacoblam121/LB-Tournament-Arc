# UI Enhancement Subphase 1: Command Consolidation - Manual Test Suite

## Overview
This test suite validates the command consolidation implementation where duplicate admin list commands have been removed and public commands enhanced with admin-level features and permission-based filtering.

## Prerequisites
- Discord bot is running and connected
- You have owner permissions (Config.OWNER_DISCORD_ID)
- Database contains clusters and events (populated via `/admin-populate-data`)
- You have access to test with both owner and non-owner Discord accounts

## Test Environment Setup

### Before Testing
1. **Verify Owner ID Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Check that your Discord ID is set as OWNER_DISCORD_ID in .env or config
   grep OWNER_DISCORD_ID .env
   ```

2. **Backup Current Database** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cp tournament.db tournament_backup_subphase_1_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db
   ```

3. **Ensure Data is Populated**:
   ```bash
   # Check if clusters and events exist
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as clusters FROM clusters;"
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as events FROM events;"
   ```

## Test 1: Command Availability and Removal

### Test 1.1: Verify Admin Commands Removed
**Objective**: Confirm duplicate admin list commands no longer exist

**Steps**:
1. In Discord, try to run: `/admin-list-clusters`
2. In Discord, try to run: `/admin-list-events`
3. Check that these commands are not available in slash command autocomplete

**Expected Results**:
- Both commands should show "Unknown command" or not appear in autocomplete
- No response from the bot when attempting to use these commands
- Only `/admin-populate-data` should remain as an admin list-related command

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 1.2: Verify Public Commands Available
**Objective**: Confirm enhanced public commands are accessible

**Steps**:
1. In Discord, type `/list-c` and check autocomplete shows `/list-clusters`
2. In Discord, type `/list-e` and check autocomplete shows `/list-events`
3. Verify both commands appear in the bot's command list

**Expected Results**:
- Both `/list-clusters` and `/list-events` are available via slash commands
- Commands appear in Discord's autocomplete suggestions
- Commands are accessible to all users (not just owner)

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

## Test 2: Permission-Based Filtering (Owner View)

### Test 2.1: Owner List-Clusters Enhanced View
**Objective**: Test admin features in list-clusters command as owner

**Steps**:
1. As the bot owner, run: `/list-clusters`
2. Observe the response embed:
   - Title should include "(Admin View)"
   - Status indicators (🟢/🔴) should be visible
   - Footer should show total/active cluster counts
   - Should see all clusters (active and inactive)

**Expected Results**:
- Title: "📋 Tournament Clusters (Admin View)"
- Green/red status indicators before each cluster
- Format: "🟢 **1.** Chess (3 events)" or "🔴 **2.** Inactive Game (0 events)"
- Footer text showing "Total: X clusters (Y active)"

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 2.2: Owner List-Events Enhanced View (All Events)

**Steps**:
1. As the bot owner, run: `/list-events`
2. Observe the response:
   - Title should include "(Admin View)"

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 2.3: Owner List-Events Enhanced View (Single Cluster)
**Objective**: Test admin features with cluster filtering

**Steps**:
1. As the bot owner, run: `/list-events cluster_name:Chess`
2. Verify enhanced admin features for single cluster view:
   - Status indicators on events
   - Footer statistics
   - Shows inactive events if any

**Expected Results**:
- Title: "🎮 Events in Chess (Admin View)"
- Events with status indicators: "🟢 **Bullet** - 1v1"

- Displays both active and inactive events in the cluster

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

## Test 3: Permission-Based Filtering (Regular User View)

### Test 3.1: Regular User List-Clusters Clean View
**Objective**: Test regular user experience with list-clusters

**Steps**:
1. **Using a non-owner Discord account**, run: `/list-clusters`
2. Observe the response:
   - No "(Admin View)" in title
   - No status indicators
   - Clean, simple format
   - Only active clusters shown
   - No admin footer information

**Expected Results**:
- Title: "📋 Tournament Clusters" (no admin suffix)

   - Only active events/clusters shown
   - Simple, readable format

**Expected Results**:
- Title: "🎮 All Tournament Events" (no admin suffix)
- Clean cluster fields: "📁 Chess" (no status indicators)
- Clean event format: "Bullet (1v1)" (no status indicators)
- Only shows active events and clusters
- No admin footer statistics

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 3.3: Regular User Cluster Filtering
**Objective**: Test cluster filtering works for regular users

**Steps**:
1. **Using a non-owner Discord account**, run: `/list-events cluster_name:Chess`
2. Verify functionality is preserved but without admin features

**Expected Results**:
- Title: "🎮 Events in Chess" (no admin suffix)
- Events listed without status indicators
- Only active events shown
- No admin footer information
- Clean, readable format for regular users

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

## Test 4: Data Integrity and Consistency

### Test 4.1: Event Count Accuracy
**Objective**: Verify event counts are accurate between admin and user views

**Steps**:
1. Run `/list-clusters` as owner, note event counts
2. Run `/list-clusters` as regular user, note event counts
3. For a specific cluster, run `/list-events cluster_name:Chess` as both owner and user
4. Compare the counts and verify logic:
   - Admin sees total events (active + inactive)
   - Users see only active events

**Expected Results**:
- Admin counts should be >= user counts for each cluster
- User counts should only include active events
- Manual verification of a specific cluster should match displayed counts
- No negative counts or obvious miscalculations

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 4.2: Cluster Status Consistency
**Objective**: Verify status indicators are consistent and meaningful

**Steps**:
1. As owner, check if any clusters show 🔴 (inactive status)
2. Verify that inactive clusters don't appear in regular user view
3. Check that active clusters show 🟢 in admin view
4. Cross-reference with database if possible:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 tournament.db "SELECT name, is_active FROM clusters WHERE is_active = 0;"
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- Status indicators accurately reflect database `is_active` status
- Inactive clusters (🔴) don't appear in user views
- Active clusters (🟢) appear in both admin and user views
- Database query results match visual indicators

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

## Test 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Test 5.1: Invalid Cluster Name Handling
**Objective**: Test error handling for non-existent clusters

**Steps**:
1. As owner, run: `/list-events cluster_name:NonExistentCluster`
2. As regular user, run: `/list-events cluster_name:InvalidName`
3. Verify both get appropriate error messages

**Expected Results**:
- Red error embed: "❌ Cluster Not Found"
- Clear message: "No cluster found with name: `InvalidName`"
- Same error handling for both admin and regular users
- Bot remains stable and responsive

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 5.2: Empty Database Handling
**Objective**: Test behavior when no data exists

**Steps**:
1. **BACKUP CURRENT DATA FIRST**
2. Temporarily clear database:
   ```bash
   cp tournament.db tournament.db.backup
   sqlite3 tournament.db "DELETE FROM events; DELETE FROM clusters;"
   ```
3. Test both commands as owner and user
4. Restore data:
   ```bash
   mv tournament.db.backup tournament.db
   ```

**Expected Results**:
- Owner sees: "No clusters found. Use `/admin-populate-data` to load from CSV."
- User sees: "No active clusters found."
- No crashes or exceptions
- Helpful guidance for resolving the empty state

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

### Test 5.3: Large Dataset Handling
**Objective**: Test pagination and limits work correctly

**Steps**:
1. Verify the response stays within Discord limits (embed character limits)
2. If you have >20 clusters, verify the "Showing first 20" message appears
3. If any cluster has >5 events, verify the "... and X more" truncation works

**Expected Results**:
- No Discord API errors about message/embed size
- Proper truncation messages when limits are exceeded
- Consistent behavior between admin and user views
- Performance remains acceptable

**Pass/Fail**: ___________

2. Check that all receive proper responses
3. Verify no conflicts or errors occur

**Expected Results**:
- All users receive appropriate responses based on their permission level
- No database conflicts or errors
- Bot remains stable under concurrent load
