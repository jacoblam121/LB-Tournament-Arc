# Phase B: Confirmation System Test Suite

## Overview
This test suite validates the match result confirmation system infrastructure added in Phase B.

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a backup of your database
2. Run the migration script first: `python migration_phase_b_confirmation_system.py`
3. Bot should not be running during tests

## Running the Tests

### Automated Test Suite
```bash
python test_phase_b_confirmation.py
```

This will run 8 automated tests covering:
1. Model and enum creation
2. Result proposal creation
3. Duplicate proposal prevention
4. Confirmation recording
5. Rejection handling
6. Cleanup and retry workflow
7. Full confirmation flow
8. Non-participant validation

### Manual Validation Tests

After running the automated tests, perform these manual checks:

#### Test 1: Database Schema Verification
```sql
-- Check new tables exist
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name IN ('match_result_proposals', 'match_confirmations');

-- Check enum value
SELECT DISTINCT status FROM matches WHERE status = 'awaiting_confirmation';
```

Expected: Both tables should exist, enum query should run without error

#### Test 2: Migration Rollback Test (Optional)
1. Restore from backup: `cp tournament_backup_phase_b.db tournament.db`
2. Re-run migration: `python migration_phase_b_confirmation_system.py`
3. Verify it completes successfully

#### Test 3: Integration with Bot
1. Start the bot
2. Create an FFA match: `!ffa @user1 @user2 @user3`
3. Try to report results: `!match-report <id> @user1:1 @user2:2 @user3:3`
4. Should still work with direct completion (Phase B doesn't change command yet)

## Expected Results

### Automated Tests
All 8 tests should pass:
```
‚úÖ Test 1: Model Creation
‚úÖ Test 2: Create Result Proposal
‚úÖ Test 3: Duplicate Proposal Prevention
‚úÖ Test 4: Record Confirmations
‚úÖ Test 5: Finalization with Rejection
‚úÖ Test 6: Cleanup and Retry
‚úÖ Test 7: Full Confirmation Flow
‚úÖ Test 8: Non-Participant Validation

üìä Test Summary
‚úÖ Passed: 8/8
‚ùå Failed: 0/8
```

### Database State After Tests
- New tables created and accessible
- MatchStatus enum includes AWAITING_CONFIRMATION
- Test data cleaned up automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure you're in the project root directory
   - Check Python path includes project root

2. **Database Locked**
   - Stop the bot before running tests
   - Close any database viewers

3. **Migration Not Run**
   - Error: "no such table: match_result_proposals"
   - Solution: Run migration first

4. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure write permissions on database file
   - Check backup file permissions

## Next Steps

After all tests pass:

1. **Phase C Implementation**: Add Discord UI with confirmation buttons
2. **Phase D Implementation**: Admin tools and edge cases
3. **Update Commands**: Modify match-report to use proposal system

## Integration Notes

The confirmation system is designed to be backward compatible:
- Direct completion still works (for admin override)
- Existing match-report command unchanged until Phase C
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
