# Phase 2.2b Enhanced Guidance Test Suite

**Test Suite:** Phase 2.2b Enhanced Guidance for 6-8 Players  
**Created:** 2025-01-26  
**Purpose:** Manual validation of enhanced guidance system for 6-8 player matches

## 🎯 **Test Overview**

This test suite validates the enhanced guidance implementation for 6-8 player matches, including:
- Auto-generated copy-paste templates with actual player names
- Rich embed structure with step-by-step instructions
- Realistic examples using shuffled placements
- Smart error recovery with corrected templates
- Performance improvements and bug fixes

## ⚙️ **Prerequisites**

### Required Setup
- Bot running with Phase 2.2b enhanced guidance implementation
- Test Discord server with bot invited
- At least 8 test users (real or bot accounts) for comprehensive testing
- Active FFA matches with 6-8 participants

### Test Data Preparation
```bash
# 1. Start the bot
python -m bot.main

# 2. Create test matches with varying participant counts
!ffa @user1 @user2 @user3 @user4 @user5           # 6 players (5 + author)
!ffa @user1 @user2 @user3 @user4 @user5 @user6    # 7 players
!ffa @user1 @user2 @user3 @user4 @user5 @user6 @user7  # 8 players

# 3. Create matches with special character names if available
!ffa @"John Doe" @user_with_underscore @user:with:colons  # Test special handling

# Note the Match IDs for testing
```

## 🧪 **Test Cases**

### **Test 1: Enhanced Guidance Display for 6 Players**

**Objective:** Verify enhanced guidance appears with rich content for 6-player matches

**Steps:**

- ✅ Format is consistent: "@PlayerName:_"
- ✅ No duplicate player names
- ✅ No missing players from the match
- ✅ Special characters handled with quotes if needed

**Test Data:**
```
Match ID: ___
Player count: ___
Template copied: _______________
All players present: [ ] Yes [ ] No
Correct format: [ ] Yes [ ] No
Special chars handled: [ ] Yes [ ] No
```

### **Test 4: Example Placement Shuffling**

**Objective:** Verify that example placements are shuffled to demonstrate order flexibility

**Steps:**
1. Generate enhanced guidance for the same match multiple times
2. Compare the example placements across different displays
3. Verify that placements are shuffled (not always 1,2,3,4,5,6...)
4. Confirm all placement numbers 1-N are used exactly once
5. Check that the format remains correct despite shuffling

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Examples show different placement orders
- ✅ All numbers 1 through N are used exactly once
- ✅ Format remains: "@Player:X" where X is placement
