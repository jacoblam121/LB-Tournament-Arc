## Project Overview

LB-Tournament-Arc is a sophisticated Discord-based tournament management system designed to handle multiple competition formats with advanced scoring mechanisms. The system supports everything from traditional 1v1 matches to large free-for-all battles, with dual scoring systems and special bonuses.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Format Support**: 1v1, FFA (Free-For-All), Team, and Leaderboard competitions
- **Dual Scoring Systems**: Traditional Elo ratings and Performance Points
- **Discord Integration**: Full hybrid command support (prefix + slash commands)
- **Automatic Player Management**: Auto-registration and stat tracking
- **Advanced Workflows**: Confirmation systems, modal interfaces, and placement tracking

## Core Systems

### 1. Elo Rating System

The Elo system is implemented in `bot/utils/elo.py` using the standard chess Elo formula with customized K-factors:

#### How Elo is Calculated

**Expected Score Formula:**
```
E_A = 1 / (1 + 10^((R_B - R_A) / 400))
```
Where:
- E_A = Expected score for player A (0.0 to 1.0)
- R_A = Player A's current rating
- R_B = Player B's current rating

**Rating Change Formula:**
```
ΔR = K × (S - E)
```
Where:
- K = K-factor (40 for provisional, 20 for established players)
- S = Actual score (1.0 for win, 0.5 for draw, 0.0 for loss)
- E = Expected score

#### K-Factor System
- **Provisional Players** (< 5 matches): K = 40
  - Higher volatility allows new players to reach their true rating faster
- **Established Players** (≥ 5 matches): K = 20
  - Lower volatility for more stable ratings

#### Multi-Player Elo (FFA)
For Free-For-All matches, the system uses pairwise comparisons:
- Total comparisons: N × (N-1) / 2
- K-factor scaled by K/(N-1) to prevent excessive volatility
- Each player is compared against every other player based on placement

### 2. Performance Points (PP) System

Performance Points are designed for non-competitive events where participation should be encouraged:
- **No Point Loss**: Players never lose PP, only gain
- **Placement-Based**: Points awarded based on final placement
- **Configured per Event**: Each event can define its own PP distribution

### 3. Crownslayer Bonus System

A special reward system for defeating the server owner:
- **Pool System**: Each event has a `crownslayer_pool` (default: 300 points)
- **Automatic Detection**: System checks if defeated player is the owner
- **One-Time Bonus**: Pool is distributed and reset after claim
- **Status**: Configured but not yet actively implemented in commands

### 4. Ticket Economy

Players earn and spend tickets through tournament participation:
- **Starting Tickets**: 0 (configurable)
- **Challenge Escrow**: 10 tickets required to issue challenges
- **Transaction Logging**: All ticket changes tracked in database
- **Future Use**: Planned for tournament entry fees and rewards

## Database Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with async support
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL-ready
- **Migrations**: Custom migration scripts for schema evolution

### Core Models Hierarchy

```
Cluster (Tournament Categories)
├── Event (Individual Competitions)
│   ├── Challenge (1v1 Invitations - Legacy)
│   └── Match (N-Player Results - NEW)
│       └── MatchParticipant (Individual Results)
└── Player (Discord Users)
    ├── EloHistory (Rating Changes)
    └── Ticket (Economy Transactions)
```

### Model Details

#### Player Model
- **Identification**: Discord ID (unique)
- **Stats**: Elo rating, tickets, matches played, W/L/D record
- **Metadata**: Registration date, last active, display name
- **Calculated Properties**: Win rate, provisional status

#### Event Model
- **Configuration**: Scoring type (1v1/FFA/Team/Leaderboard)
- **Limits**: Min/max players, challenge permissions
- **Inheritance**: Absorbed functionality from deprecated Game model
- **Unique Constraint**: Name must be unique within cluster

#### Challenge Model (Legacy - 2 Players Only)
- **Purpose**: Handles 1v1 match invitations
- **Limitation**: Hardcoded to 2 players (challenger_id, challenged_id)
- **Status Flow**: Pending → Accepted/Declined → Completed
- **Expiry**: 24-hour timeout
- **Future**: Will become pure invitation system

#### Match Model (NEW - N Players)
- **Purpose**: Records actual game results for any player count
- **Flexibility**: Supports 1v1, FFA, Team battles
- **Timing**: Tracks start and completion times
- **Discord Integration**: Stores channel and message IDs
- **Link**: Optional connection to Challenge for 1v1 matches

#### MatchParticipant Model (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Individual player results within a match
- **Placement**: Numeric ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
- **Score Tracking**: Elo change, PP change, points earned
- **Team Support**: Optional team_id and team_name fields
- **Verification**: Stores before/after ratings

#### Supporting Models

**EloHistory**
- Tracks every rating change with context
- Links to matches and challenges
- Stores old/new ratings and change amount

**MatchResultProposal** (Phase B)
- Temporary storage for proposed match results
- 24-hour expiration
- Links to Discord message for updates

**MatchConfirmation** (Phase B)
- Individual player confirmations
- Supports accept/reject with timestamps
- Enables democratic result validation

### Database Transactions

All multi-table operations use atomic transactions:
```python
async with self.session.begin():
    # Create match
    # Create participants  
    # Update player stats
    # Record Elo history
    # All succeed or all fail
```

## Discord Bot Commands

### Player Commands (NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL)

**Status**: Code exists in `bot/cogs/player.py` but commands are not loaded/working in Discord

#### Implemented But Non-Functional
- **Commands**: `!register`, `!signup` - Player registration
- **Commands**: `!profile`, `!stats`, `!me` [member] - Profile viewing  
- **Commands**: `!leaderboard`, `!top`, `!rankings` [limit] - Leaderboard display

**Issue**: These commands exist in the codebase but are not accessible in the live Discord bot. Only slash commands (`/`) from match_commands.py are currently functional.

**Auto-Registration Workaround**: Players are automatically registered when they participate in match creation, bypassing the need for explicit registration commands.

### Match Commands (CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL)

**Status**: Only these commands are loaded and working in the live Discord bot

#### FFA Creation
- **Commands**: `/ffa` (slash command only)
- **Function**: Creates Free-For-All match for 3-16 players
- **Features**:
  - Auto-includes command author
  - Auto-registers new players
  - Creates event if needed
  - Returns match ID for reporting

#### Match Reporting
- **Commands**: `/match-report` (slash command only)
- **Syntax**: `/match-report <match_id> @user1:1 @user2:2 ...`
- **Features**:
  - Permission check (participants or admin only)
  - Modal interface for ≤5 players (slash command)
  - Template system for 6-10 players
  - Confirmation workflow (all players must confirm)
  - Shows Elo changes for each player
  - Admin force option to skip confirmation

#### Test Command
- **Commands**: `/ping`
- **Function**: Test bot connectivity and slash command infrastructure

#### Modal System (≤5 Players)
- **Trigger**: Slash command with 5 or fewer participants
- **Interface**: Dynamic text fields for each player
- **Validation**: Ensures unique placements
- **Timeout**: 15 minutes

#### Confirmation Workflow
- **Requirement**: All participants must confirm results
- **Expiration**: 24 hours
- **Rejection**: Any rejection cancels the proposal
- **Auto-Confirm**: Proposer automatically confirmed

### Admin Commands

#### Bot Management
- **Commands**: `!shutdown` (owner only)
- **Function**: Gracefully shuts down the bot

#### Development Tools
- **Commands**: `!reload <cog_name>` (owner only)
- **Function**: Hot-reload specific cogs without restart

#### Database Stats
- **Commands**: `!dbstats` (owner only)
- **Function**: Shows player count, game count, challenge count

### Placeholder Commands

These commands exist but show "coming soon" messages:
- `!challenge` - Legacy 1v1 challenge system
- `!ranks` - Advanced ranking features
- `!tournaments` - Tournament management

## Recent Architectural Changes

### Phase 2A1: Game → Event Migration (Complete)
- **Problem**: Duplicate models (Game and Event) causing confusion
- **Solution**: Migrated all Game functionality into Event model
- **Impact**: Single source of truth for competition configuration

### Phase 2A2: Challenge → Match Separation (Complete)
- **Problem**: Challenge model limited to 2 players
- **Solution**: Created Match/MatchParticipant models for N-player support
- **Architecture**:
  - Challenge: Handles invitations (legacy, 2-player only)
  - Match: Handles results (supports N players)
  - Bridge: 1v1 matches can link to originating challenge

### Phase 2.2a: Modal Infrastructure (Complete)
- **Feature**: Dynamic Discord modals for result entry
- **Limitation**: Discord supports max 5 text inputs
- **Implementation**: Automatic fallback to template system for >5 players

### Phase B: Confirmation System (Complete)
- **Feature**: Democratic result validation
- **Tables**: MatchResultProposal, MatchConfirmation
- **Workflow**: Propose → Confirm/Reject → Apply/Cancel
- **Security**: Prevents unilateral result manipulation

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Hybrid Command Pattern
```python
@commands.hybrid_command(name="ffa", description="Create FFA match")
@app_commands.describe(players="Players for the match")
async def ffa(self, ctx, *, players: str):
    # Parse string into member list
    members = await self._parse_members_from_string(ctx, players)
```

#### Member Parsing Helper
Robust parsing supporting:
- Mentions: `@username`
- IDs: `123456789`
- Names with spaces: `"First Last"`
- Mixed formats in single command

#### Error Handling
- Global error handlers for both command types
- User-friendly error embeds
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation

#### Performance Optimizations
- Eager loading with SQLAlchemy relationships
- Bulk operations for multi-player updates
- K-factor scaling for FFA matches
- Connection pooling for database

### Migration Strategy

All migrations follow strict principles:
1. **Additive Only**: Never remove active columns/tables
2. **Dual Support**: Maintain both systems during transition
3. **Feature Flags**: Gradual rollout with config toggles
4. **Data Integrity**: Foreign keys and constraints enforced
5. **Rollback Plan**: Each phase can be reverted if needed

### Current Capabilities

**What Users Can Actually Do (Live Discord Commands):**
- Create FFA matches (3-16 players) via `/ffa` ✅
- Report match results with placements via `/match-report` ✅
- Test bot connectivity via `/ping` ✅
- Auto-registration when participating in matches ✅
- Confirm/reject proposed results (Phase B confirmation system) ✅
- View Elo changes after matches ✅

**What's NOT Working (Despite Code Existing):**
- Manual player registration (`!register` commands) ❌ **[PLANNED FOR DEPRECATION]**
- View profiles/stats (`!profile` commands) ❌
- Check leaderboards (`!leaderboard` commands) ❌
- Challenge system (`!challenge` commands) ❌
- Tournament management commands ❌

**What's Ready in Backend (Not Exposed via Commands):**
- Full N-player match support
- Team battle infrastructure  
- Performance Points system
- Crownslayer bonus system
- Comprehensive logging and transaction management
- Database models for all features

**Planned Architectural Decisions:**
- **Deprecate Manual Registration**: Remove `!register`, `!signup` commands entirely
  - **Rationale**: Auto-registration during match participation is frictionless and sufficient for friends server
  - **Simplification**: Eliminates broken code, reduces maintenance burden
  - **Rules**: Will be posted in dedicated Discord channel instead of registration flow

**What's Coming Next:**
- Fix player info command loading issues (`/profile`, `/leaderboard`)
- Remove deprecated registration commands from codebase
- Team battle commands (`/team`)
- Tournament bracket management
- Scheduled events
- Advanced statistics dashboard

This implementation represents a robust, scalable tournament system with careful attention to data integrity, user experience, and future extensibility.
